Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it. Check the data type of this variable.
pi = 22 / 7
print(type(pi))  # This will output: <class 'float'>
Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
for = 4
Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3 years.
P = 1000  # Principal amount
R = 5  # Rate of interest in percentage
T = 3  # Time in years

Simple_Interest = (P * R * T) / 100
print(Simple_Interest)
